# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
x=eval(input())
print('52' in x)
print('12' in x)
```

## Output


![442905151-f7900f1e-e734-4e3c-9976-9c86d4a8b79a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c36abd9-7350-449c-bf9d-d62989645a32)


## Result

The program successfully checks for the existence of both 'n' and 8 in the tuple and prints the results.
